                <p>The Ganaraska River (affectionately known as "The Ganny"), is well known to area anglers for annual salmon and trout runs. It has caused many historic floods, the most recent having been in April, 1980. Every April since, Port Hope has commemorated the flood with "Float Your Fanny Down the Ganny" ten kilometer river race.[9][10][11] "Participants range from serious paddlers navigating the cold, fast moving water in kayaks and canoes, to the very entertaining 'crazy craft' paddlers, floating any combination of materials down the river in an attempt to reach the finish line."</p>
